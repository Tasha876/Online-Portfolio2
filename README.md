## 1. Description
This is a portfolio of what I've done!

### Notes:
1. I got rid of the contact form because it seemed outdated.
1. ~~The link to my resume currently does not work but I will fix this before I start applying to jobs.~~ This works now!
1. This is otherwise pretty much the exact same as my non-react portfolio.

## 5. Next steps
- [x] ~~Get link to resume to work.~~
- [x] ~~Maybe implement a sort of slideshow for my projects to take more advantage of React's features~~ (note: did this but didn't end up liking it, if you really want to see it `git checkout carousel`)
