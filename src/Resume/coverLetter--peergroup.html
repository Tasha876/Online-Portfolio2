        <p>Hello PeerGroup team,</p>
    
        <p>I am a Frontend Web Developer and recent Bachelor of Math graduate from the University of Waterloo who has just completed the University of Toronto's Coding Bootcamp. Finding out about your <em>Web Developer</em> position through <em>your website</em> not only inspired me to apply but reminded me of how far I've come in a short time-span.</p>
        <p>Just a few short months ago, I graduated and was struggling to find a career that would utilize both my creative and more investigative skills. Now I feel confident that I have found my next path as a Web Developer and working with <em>PeerGroup</em> would be the best possible next step.</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in design and learning new technologies and my recent graduation from U of T's Coding Bootcamp, shows that whether it be Git, React, Node, or MySQL, I am capable of picking up languages and applications fast. My portfolio demonstrates my creative knack, and my attention to detail as well as my ability to deploy, maintain and constantly improve clean websites that are easy to navigate.</p>
        <p>Looking at my past experience, you will find that when collaborating with team members to come up with the best solutions to enhance customers’ experience, I go above and beyond. At Nordia, I created a JavaScript based call flow at the start of the pandemic to help my team determine the proper information to give the consumer when we were urgently needed to fulfil orders for a product that was new to us.</p>
        <p>It would be a privilege to mesh my skills with <em>PeerGroup’s</em> originality and unique, friendly atmosphere and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
        <p>Best wishes,</p>
        <p class="signature">Natasha Fray</p>
